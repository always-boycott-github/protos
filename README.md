**Protos** is an open-source project that enables individuals and small organizations to take full control of their digital identity and data, by allowing them to self-host applications on public cloud providers or their own hardware. Currently Protos is under heavy development and only has alpha quality releases.

## Features ##

Some of the following features are currently half-baked or non-existent but this project aims to deliver at the minimum the following features:

- self-sovereign identity - currently a user is required to own a domain name that can be used with a Protos instance. In the future a harder form of cryptographic identity will be implemented based on public-key cryptography, leveraging the framework developed by [DIF](https://identity.foundation).
- application store - installing an application is as easy as clicking a button.
- service based architecture - applications can leverage resources and services provided by other applications installed on the platform.
- full data ownership - applications store their data locally on the Protos instance. Local data is encrypted at rest while backups sent to 3rd party services are also encrypted.
